<h1>Introduction</h1>

<div class="section">
<p>
Early hacking in the pre-web era was less about crime and more about curiosity. 
Rooted in 1970s phone-phreaking and the experimental culture of early home computers, 
hacking originally meant exploring systems, tinkering with hardware and software, 
and understanding how things worked beneath the surface. These early communities 
valued learning, creativity, and the free exchange of information long before the 
Internet became a commercial space.
</p>

<p>
As the web exploded in the 1990s, the meaning of “hacker” shifted dramatically. 
While real hackers built communities around openness and shared knowledge, the 
public encountered hacking mainly through media portrayals—many of them exaggerated, 
sensationalized, or misleading. This project focuses not on a chronological history, 
but on how hacking was interpreted, misinterpreted, and transformed in the public 
imagination. By contrasting authentic hacker ethics with their media caricatures, 
we can better understand how the early web was shaped by both cultural fascination 
and technological fear.
