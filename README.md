Hacker Culture & Ethics: 1990s to Today

Author: Fernanda Lima

This project is a retro-styled web essay exploring how hacker culture emerged and evolved from the early Internet era to today. It contrasts authentic hacker ethics—curiosity, openness, decentralization—with the sensationalized portrayals created by 1990s film and news media.

The site also highlights how these early principles shaped open-source software and continue to influence modern digital-rights movements such as right-to-repair, jailbreaking, and resistance to restrictive “smart” technologies.

The webpage is built using a 1990s terminal/Matrix-inspired aesthetic to reflect the visual culture of the early web.
