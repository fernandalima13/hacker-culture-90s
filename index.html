    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Early hacking in the pre-web era was less about crime and more about curiosity. Rooted in 1970s phone-phreaking and the experimental culture of early home computers, hacking originally meant exploring systems, tinkering with hardware and software, and understanding how things worked beneath the surface. These early communities valued learning, creativity, and the free exchange of information long before the Internet became a commercial space.</p>
        
        <p>As the web exploded in the 1990s, the meaning of “hacker” shifted dramatically. While real hackers built communities around openness and shared knowledge, the public encountered hacking mainly through media portrayals, many of them exaggerated, sensationalized, or misleading. This project focuses not on a chronological history, but on how hacking was interpreted, misinterpreted, and transformed in the public imagination. By contrasting authentic hacker ethics with their media caricatures, we can better understand how both cultural fascination and technological fear shaped the early web.</p>

        <h2>Media Panic in the 1990s</h2>

        <h3>1. Pop-Culture Hackers as “Cool Outlaws”</h3>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="hackers-movie.jpg" alt="Comparison of Hackers movie poster and The Net movie poster">
            <figcaption>[FIG.1]: Hollywood's Dual Narrative: The "Cool Outlaw" vs. The "Terrifying Threat"</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>In the 1990s, mainstream films played a major role in shaping how the public imagined hackers. Much of the general population had never used the Internet, and movies became their first exposure to digital culture. Hackers (1995) presented hacking as a vibrant, rebellious subculture, fast-paced, neon-lit, and creatively chaotic. The characters rollerblade through New York, swap code like street poetry, and outsmart corporations with style. While exaggerated, the film framed hackers as anti-authoritarian heroes who used their technical skills to expose corruption and challenge powerful institutions. This portrayal reinforced the idea of hackers as “cool outlaws,” a cultural trope that made technical experimentation seem exciting rather than threatening.</p>
        
        <p>By contrast, The Net (1995) portrayed hacking as a terrifying threat to personal identity and digital safety. Sandra Bullock’s character has her entire life erased through database manipulation, suggesting that hackers had nearly limitless power over modern systems. Where Hackers glamorized digital rebellion, The Net presented a world where ordinary people were vulnerable to unseen technical forces. These films offered contradictory depictions, hackers as both folk heroes and invisible criminals, but both contributed to the perception that the digital world was unpredictable and dangerous (Softley 1995; Winkler 1995).</p>
        
        <p>Together, these films created a narrative in which hackers were not simply computer enthusiasts, but figures who symbolized autonomy, danger, and the mystery of a rapidly emerging technological era.</p>

        <h3>2. News Media Creating Fear & Uncertainty</h3>
        <p>If Hollywood provided the fantasy, the news media provided the fear. Articles like Charles Platt’s “Hackers: Threat or Menace?” published in WIRED (1994), highlighted the contradictory fascination and anxiety surrounding hackers. While WIRED was more tech-literate than most outlets, it even described hackers as unpredictable forces capable of breaching corporate and government systems. This framing fed into a broader cultural unease: computers were suddenly everywhere, yet most people did not understand how they worked.</p>
        
        <p>Mainstream newspapers took this framing even further. Throughout the 1990s, headlines about teenage hackers breaking into NASA, the Pentagon, or major financial institutions became common. Many of these intrusions were exploratory rather than malicious, but media outlets emphasized danger, vulnerability, and criminality. Reporters frequently described hackers as shadowy figures operating from bedrooms or basements, reinforcing the idea that the Internet was a lawless space filled with invisible threats. This fear was amplified by the fact that the “average” reader had no firsthand experience with the Internet — making sensational coverage especially impactful.</p>
        
        <p>Rather than presenting hacking as technical learning or digital curiosity, news outlets treated every incident as a national security risk. This created a feedback loop: the less the public understood about computers, the more frightening these narratives felt.</p>

        <h3>3. Why Media Panic Mattered</h3>
        <p>Media panic contributed to a policy climate that criminalized a wide range of unauthorized access. Laws and prosecutorial practices expanded in the 1990s, often treating exploratory intrusion with the same legal reflexes as malicious attacks. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and related statutes were interpreted and applied in ways that broadened the definition of criminal computer access; enforcement was often shaped by public fear and the desire to demonstrate control over emerging threats.</p>
        
        <p>Simultaneously, institutions, universities, corporations, and government agencies invested heavily in defensive infrastructures, public relations campaigns, and compliance mechanisms. Cybersecurity matured into an industry in part because of the political energy generated by those fearful narratives: companies found a market for security tools, and governments found justification for expanded investigative powers.</p>
        
        <p>These portrayals shaped public relationships to digital spaces. Many early Internet users approached the web cautiously, influenced by warnings that ordinary people could be targeted by unseen online criminals. Fear-based narratives affected how the public understood privacy, data, and online identity, framing the Internet as a place where danger was ever-present.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, the stereotypes created during the 1990s persist today. The “hoodie-wearing hacker” image, commonly seen in news graphics and cybersecurity campaigns, traces directly back to these films and headlines. Even as hacking has evolved from 90s tinkerers to modern security researchers, open-source developers, and digital rights activists, the cultural legacy of media panic continues to shape how society interprets hacking today.</p>

    <section id="ethics">
        <h2>Key Ethical Principles of Early Hacker Culture</h2>
        <p>Long before hacking became associated with cybercrime and digital espionage, early hacker communities embraced a distinct set of ethical values. These values were not written laws but cultural norms shared among hobbyists, students, phone-phreakers, and early computer enthusiasts. Their philosophy is best captured in The Hacker Manifesto (1986), published in Phrack by the hacker known as The Mentor. In it, he describes hacking as a search for knowledge, a curiosity about how systems work, and a refusal to accept arbitrary restrictions on information. The Manifesto rejects the idea that education, intelligence, or opportunity should depend on class, wealth, or credentials. Skills, not status, were what mattered.</p>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="manifesto-screen.gif" alt="Screenshot of the original Hacker Manifesto on a BBS terminal">
            <figcaption>[FIG.2]: "The Conscience of a Hacker" (1986) as seen on a Bulletin Board System</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Douglas Thomas, in Hacker Culture (2002), expands this idea into a broader cultural ethos. Early hackers saw computers as tools for empowerment: machines that allowed individuals to create, experiment, and innovate without needing permission. Thomas argues that the early hacker community developed its own version of meritocracy: the belief that technical skill and creativity were the true markers of value, not degrees or institutional power. This meritocracy was built through hands-on exploration; hackers learned by doing, breaking, fixing, and tinkering. The process of discovery was itself a moral value.</p>
        
        <p>Eric S. Raymond’s The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1998) illustrates how these values shaped open-source development. Raymond contrasts the “cathedral” model (closed, hierarchical, controlled by expert gatekeepers) with the “bazaar” model of open collaboration. In the bazaar, anyone can contribute, code is freely shared, and innovation emerges from collective effort. This model was not only technically successful; it reflected the cultural belief that “information wants to be free.” Open systems were seen as inherently better for learning, creativity, and community.</p>
        
        <p>Sherry Turkle’s Life on the Screen (1995) helps explain the psychological appeal of these values. For many early hackers, computers offered a space of identity experimentation — an escape from rigid social expectations. Hacking became a way to participate in a world where ideas mattered more than appearances, background, or authority. Turkle notes that the early digital world gave individuals the ability to “reinvent themselves” through mastery of systems, creating a sense of agency that matched the hacker ethic of autonomy and intellectual freedom.</p>
        
        <p>Across these sources, the core principles of early hacker ethics emerge clearly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information should be free and accessible.</li>
            <li>Systems should be open so people can learn how they work.</li>
            <li>Meritocracy is based on skill, not formal credentials.</li>
            <li>Authority should be questioned, especially when it limits access to knowledge.</li>
            <li>Learning happens through exploration, experimentation, and tinkering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These ideas shaped not just technical practices but the moral identity of early hacker communities.</p>

        <h3>Tension Between Hacker Ethics and Media Narratives</h3>
        <p>While hackers understood their work as exploration and learning, mainstream media framed the same actions as criminal or dangerous. This tension is central to understanding 1990s Internet culture.</p>
        
        <p>News outlets tended to portray hackers as intruders, criminals, or social threats, figures who broke into systems for profit or chaos. Films amplified these fears, depicting hackers as either glamorous digital rebels or invisible enemies capable of erasing identities or crashing national infrastructure. In these portrayals, hacking was defined by transgression rather than curiosity.</p>
        
        <p>But within hacker communities, the same behaviors carried different meanings. Accessing a system wasn’t necessarily an attempt to cause harm; it was often a way to understand how it functioned. Exploring code or bypassing security wasn’t vandalism; it was problem-solving. Hackers valued collaboration, shared learning, and the belief that systems improved when more people understood them.</p>
        
        <p>Douglas Thomas writes that media panic “flattened” the complexity of hacker culture into a single stereotype, obscuring the distinction between curiosity-driven exploration and malicious intent. Raymond argues that the cultural value of openness, so essential to open-source development, was misunderstood outside hacker communities. Instead of seeing collaboration and transparency as virtues, the public interpreted them as vulnerabilities.</p>
        
        <p>The result is a persistent cultural divide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Media narrative:</strong> Hackers are criminals, intruders, or threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Hacker self-understanding:</strong> Hackers are learners, tinkerers, problem-solvers, and collaborators.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This divide fueled the panic surrounding hacking in the 1990s and contributed to long-lasting misconceptions about digital culture. The ethical frameworks that guided early hackers, the commitments to openness, meritocracy, and free information, were overshadowed by sensational portrayals emphasizing fear and criminality. Understanding this tension is crucial to understanding not only the early web but the evolution of digital culture today.</p>

    <section id="legacy">
        <h2>Legacy: From 1990s Hackers to Today’s Digital Activism</h2>
        
        <h3>Today’s Public Perception of Hackers</h3>
        <p>The public meaning of the word hacker has shifted dramatically since the 1990s. In that decade, pop culture cast hackers as rebellious but charismatic outsiders, young people who challenged authority, exposed weaknesses in powerful systems, and embraced the Internet as a frontier of freedom. Films like Hackers (1995) depicted them as digital punks with neon aesthetics and countercultural flair, while even sensational news stories often marveled at the idea of curious teenagers breaking into NASA or major corporations. The hacker was dangerous, but also clever, creative, and often oddly admirable.</p>
        
        <p>Today, that image has largely disappeared. In contemporary media, hackers are typically framed as criminals, threats, or geopolitical weapons. News outlets focus on ransomware attacks on hospitals, data breaches affecting millions of consumers, and large-scale intrusions by state-sponsored groups. As digital infrastructures have become essential to everyday life, such as connecting power grids, medical systems, financial markets, and personal identity, the figure of the hacker has been recast as a symbol of fear rather than exploration. As anthropologist Gabriella Coleman notes in Coding Freedom (2012), the shift from “hacker as tinkerer” to “hacker as threat” reflects broader anxieties about surveillance, cybersecurity, and the fragility of digital systems.</p>
        
        <p>The transition is not only cultural but structural: in the 1990s, hacking took place on an Internet that was still experimental, decentralized, and relatively low-stakes. Today, breaches affect billions of dollars, national security, and the personal privacy of entire populations. As a result, the hacker’s symbolic meaning evolved from subcultural figure → curiosity-driven tinkerer → global security threat. This change provides the backdrop for understanding why modern digital resistance movements evoke 1990s hacker ethics, even if the label “hacker” now carries a different public weight.</p>

        <h3>Modern Parallels to 1990s Hacker Ethics</h3>
        <p>Despite changes in public perception, many of the ethical principles that defined early hacker culture continue to shape contemporary technology activism. These modern movements inherit the same values described in early texts like The Hacker Manifesto (1986), Eric S. Raymond’s The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1998), and Douglas Thomas’s Hacker Culture (2002): openness, autonomy, curiosity, and resistance to closed systems. Below are the clearest parallels:</p>

        <h4>1. Jailbreaking and Device Liberation</h4>
        <p>Jailbreaking iPhones, modifying game consoles, and unlocking VR headsets all reflect the same ethos of “systems should be open for exploration.” Just as early hackers resisted closed, proprietary computer systems, today’s device liberation communities push back against corporate control over hardware and software. Their argument is simple and deeply aligned with 1990s ethics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users should have the right to modify, repair, or access the devices they own.</li>
            <li>Locked-down systems restrict learning, innovation, and creativity.</li>
            <li>Tinkering is a form of knowledge-making, not deviance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This reflects Thomas’s argument that hacking is fundamentally about agency: the desire to shape technology rather than passively consume it.</p>

        <h4>2. The Right-to-Repair Movement</h4>
        <p>The modern Right-to-Repair movement is one of the clearest descendants of early hacker philosophy. Organizations and advocates challenge companies like Apple, Tesla, and John Deere that prevent independent repair by restricting access to tools, manuals, or replacement parts.</p>
        <p>This movement extends the 1980s–90s principle that information wants to be free into a new formulation: Hardware should be fixable, inspectable, and modifiable.</p>
        <p>At its core, Right-to-Repair embodies the bazaar model Raymond celebrates: distributed knowledge, community collaboration, and freedom from centralized control.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="iphone-repair.jpg" alt="A disassembled modern smartphone">
            <figcaption>[FIG.3]: Modern "Tinkering": Disassembling proprietary hardware to reclaim ownership</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>3. Open-Source Communities (Linux / GNU)</h4>
        <p>Linux, GNU, and other open-source ecosystems represent the most explicit continuation of 1990s hacker ethics. They thrive on the bazaar model described by Raymond: thousands of contributors, decentralized leadership, free redistribution of code, and a shared belief that transparency makes systems stronger. The motivations behind open-source software parallel the values expressed in The Hacker Manifesto: curiosity, collective improvement, independence from corporate gatekeeping, and the belief that technology should empower rather than restrict.</p>
        <p>Open-source communities are both a historical continuation and a modern evolution of early hacker culture. They maintain the same ideals but operate at a global scale unimaginable in the 1990s.</p>

        <h4>4. Resistance to “Smart Tech” That Limits User Autonomy</h4>
        <p>Today, much of the technology framed as “smart” is, in reality, subscription-based, user-hostile, filled with ads, designed to prevent repair, and dependent on cloud services that can disappear at any time.</p>
        <p>Refrigerators require monthly fees to use certain features; printers disable themselves if users install non-OEM ink; cars track drivers via embedded telemetry systems. Scholars like Bernal (The Cultural Construction of Cybersecurity, 2021) argue that modern smart tech often shifts power away from individuals and toward corporations, making users dependent on opaque systems they can’t control.</p>
        <p>In response, a wave of modern digital resistance has emerged: communities that root devices, remove bloatware, self-host software, or deliberately avoid “smart” ecosystems. These actions reflect the same anti-authoritarian ethos described by early hackers: that technology should empower its users, not the institution behind it.</p>

        <h3>The hacker ethos persists, but the context has changed</h3>
        <p>What unites all these movements is a shared desire to reclaim autonomy over technology. Unlike the 1990s, today’s struggles are not about exploring the unknown Internet; they are about resisting corporate structures that limit user agency. This does not mean hacker ethics have vanished; in fact, they have become more relevant. But the stakes are different:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Instead of fighting closed mainframes, users fight locked-down consumer electronics.</li>
            <li>Instead of battling for open networks, they battle for privacy and data ownership.</li>
            <li>Instead of being portrayed as cool outlaws, activists are often cast as security risks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The transformation of the hacker figure reflects the transformation of the digital world itself.</p>
        
        <p>Understanding the connection between 1990s hacker ethics and today’s digital activism illustrates how cultural values persist even as technological structures change. Early hackers believed in openness, creativity, and user autonomy—principles that inspired open-source software, digital rights movements, and collaborative online communities. Although the media portrayal of hackers shifted toward fear and criminality, the underlying ethos survived.</p>
        
        <p>Today’s battles over privacy, data rights, and device ownership are direct descendants of the earlier fight against closed systems. The original hacker ethic provides a framework for understanding why users resist proprietary technologies, subscription-based ecosystems, surveillance-driven “smart tech,” and restrictions on repair. The stakes are higher now: control of technology shapes identity, privacy, and the everyday ability to participate in modern life.</p>
        
        <p>By tracing this continuity, we see that hacker culture was never just a phase of the 1990s—it was a foundational philosophy that continues to influence how people engage with digital systems. The legacy of the early hacker ethos lives on in every push for transparency, openness, and user empowerment.</p>
